Projec title: Analyzing Happy Moments: Where Does Happiness Come From?

This project is conducted by Wenhe Chen

Project summary: This blog explores different aspects of the sources of happy moments through an in-depth analysis of the HappyDB dataset. Using the opinions of more than 100,000 people about happy moments, the authors found that kinship and achievement were the most common sources of happiness. Frequent words such as "date" and "successful" further reveal that happiness is closely linked to social interaction and personal achievement. Sentiment analysis shows that people use positive words when describing happy moments but also negative words to emphasize the uniqueness or value of happy moments. The descriptions of happiness by age and gender groups also showed some differences.
